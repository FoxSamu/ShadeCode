# ShadeCode
A color scheme for IntelliJ and other JetBrains IDE's.

ShadeCode comes in two verions. Version 1 is a colder theme with blue, green and yellow as primary colors. Version 2 is a warmer theme with red, cyan, green and orange as primary colors. Both schemes are designed for Java development, but work for most languages supported by IntelliJ. In other JetBrains IDE (PyCharm, CLion, etc.), you might want to change some colors for some languages.
